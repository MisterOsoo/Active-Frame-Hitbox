# Active-Frame-Hitbox
# Godot Combat Components

A lightweight, modular combat component toolkit for Godot 4, developed by BearBuild Studio.

Build reusable combat systems using independent Hitbox, Hurtbox, and Health components without writing the same combat logic for every character.

## Features

### Active Frame Hitbox
- Animation-based active frames
- Configurable damage
- Collision shape generation
- Inspector-exposed settings
- Designed for attacks with specific damage windows

### Hurtbox
- Receives damage from attacks
- Forwards damage to a HealthComponent
- Supports damage signals
- Configurable collision shapes

### HealthComponent
- Reusable health management
- Handles damage and healing
- Supports character death logic
- Can be attached to different characters and enemies

## Installation

1. Download the plugin from the Godot Asset Library or GitHub.
2. Copy `addons/active-frame-hitbox/` into your Godot project's `addons/` folder.

## Basic Usage

### HealthComponent
Add a HealthComponent node to a character and configure its health settings in the Inspector.
